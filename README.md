# Stylit

A mobile app that combines text-to-image synthesis and style transfer using generative artificial intelligence techniques. The app aims to empower users to generate realistic images directly from textual descriptions and explore various artistic styles for customization. The key contributions include a unified mobile application with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in image generation on the cloud, as well as a robust style transfer algorithm on the device.
